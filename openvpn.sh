# OpenVPN road warrior installer for Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS

# This script will work on Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS and probably other distros
# of the same families, although no support is offered for them. It isn't
# bulletproof but it will probably work if you simply want to setup a VPN on
# your Debian/Ubuntu/CentOS box. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and
# universal as possible.
